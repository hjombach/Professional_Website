                    <p style="text-align:left;"> A
                       considerable amount of research suggests that acute
                       changes in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, sunlight,
                       precipitation, levels of pollution) may be associated with negative
                       human behaviors. The mechanism of the relationship between these environmental
                       factors and violence / impulsivity is still unknown, however it may be due to
                       neurobiological changes caused by these factors. A small summary of research
                       is noted below:
                    </p>

                          Controlling for temperature and weather, changes in
                          levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone across the United States show
                          significant acute effects on violent crimes, with a particular
                          emphasis on assaults.
                          However, the researchers found no relationship between
                          levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or ozone and non-violent
                          property crimes. (Burkhardt et al., 2019).

                          In Southern California, long term increased exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> is
                          associated with increased adolescent delinquent behavior
                           (Younan et al., 2018).

                       <li style="text-align:left;">
                          Researchers found an association
                          between acute exposure to nitrogen dioxide and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and increased incidents of
                          completed suicide in Salt Lake County, Utah
                          (Bakian et al., 2014).

                          Maryland, maximum daily temperature was the most important weather
                          factor associated with violence and trauma, as measured
                          by hospital admissions and police reports (Michel et al., 2016).

                          and unemployment, variations in ambient ozone levels
                          explain roughly 23% of variation in the number of suicides.
                          This relationship was particularly pronounced with suicide by violent
                          methods (Yang et al., 2011).

         Due to the availability of pollutant and weather information, and the desire to minimize
         the impact of geographic variations in the levels of pollution, the analysis was restricted to shootings
         which occurred in  Bronx County.

      <p style="text-align:left;">After visualizing the data, I could see that the distribution of

       Prior to analysis, I investigated feature distributions and temporal patterns
       in the features. After plotting distributions, the distribution of sulfur dioxide was considerably
       skewed to the right, thus I chose to log transform the data to a distribution more comporable to the
       other features. Further, after visualizing the distribution of precipitation data, I chose to remove
       this variable from the analysis. The overwhelming majority of days had no precipitation, thus
       the imbalance of values may have a negative impact on the models. <br><br>

       Next my goal was to see if there were seasonal changes in the environmental conditions and numbers of shootings.

          Here I found it interesting to see that levels of ozone and maximum temperature displayed an extremely similar
          seasonal pattern to the number of shootings, whereas sulfur dioxide levels were nearly the exact opposite, something
          to keep in mind.

         <p style = "text-align:left;"> <b>Poisson Regression</b><br><br>
        Because my dependent variable was a count measure (the number of shootings in a day), I chose
        the Poisson Regression for my initial analysis. <br><br>
        However when evaluating the results, I discovered that the model displayed considerable overdispersion,
        violating an underlying assumption of the Poisson distribution. This is problematic as it can
        cause the model to provide inaccurate estimates and significance values.

        One solution to this problem is the Negative Binomial Regression, which I evaluated next.

         <p style = "text-align:left;"> <b>Negative Binomial Regression</b><br><br>

           Each of the environmental features display a significant relationship with the number of shootings which occur in Bronx County,
           except for the levels of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Of those which are significant, all but nitrogen dioxide display a positive relationship.
           <br><br>
           In the figure above, the incident rate ratios (IRR) represent the factor by which the expected number
           of shootings would change when the chosen feature is increased by X units. The standard IRRs are associated with a change of one
           unit in the corresponding feature, however due to the wide range of nitrogen dioxide levels, maximum temperature, and barometric
           pressure, the corresponding IRRs were adjusted to display the expected change in the number of shooting incidents with a ten unit
           increase in these variables.
          <br><br>
          The variable most strongly associated with changes in the number of shootings was levels of carbon monoxide. The
          expected number of shootings were expected to increase by a factor of 2.08 when carbon monoxide levels increased by 1 unit.
          It should be noted, however, that the range of carbon monoxide values in the data is less than 2 units (parts per million)
          <br><br>
          It is interesting that ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are the pollutants in our analysis that do not show a significant relationship with the number
          of shootings, as other studies have found these specific pollutants to be associated with violence in their analyses. Regardless, the results of the analysis
          do provide further evidence that the daily levels of pollution and temperature exhibit a relationship with violence.
